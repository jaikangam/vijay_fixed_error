<p>The team is very happy to announce the second birthday of VirtueMart 2.</p>
<p>Within the two last years more than 1.5 million downloads have been made. Each release included massive improvements with constant and steady development. We are happy to know that the vm2 ecosystem is running well and there are so many extensions that adds value to VirtueMart, like payment and shipment systems, SEM, product builder and so much more.</p>
<p>VirtueMart 2.2 is on the way and we have reached already at least one milestone of the roadmap. We pay a lot attention on getting a more robust and compatible code. The changes are often not visible and just noticeable by developers working with it. Our goals for next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced customfields (already developed, needs to be tested)</li>
<li>enhanced cart (less code, more secure, easier to extend, more flexible, simpler OPCs)</li>
<li>joomla 3 compatibility (added vmText, vmRequest, vmCheckToken, ...)</li>
<li>jquery 1.8 (same as j3 uses)</li>
<li>better encapsulated js</li>
<li>fine grained rights management using the joomla ACL (Access Control List)</li>
<li>JformFields for payment/shipment plugins</li>
</ul>

<p>This release is introducing SOFORT Banking, a popular payment solution in 10 european countries. We also integrated some bug fixes again, see the <a href="http://virtuemart.net/#ListBugs">list</a> below.</p>
<h2>SOFORT Banking: The attractive payment method for you</h2>
<p>Your customers simply pay in your online shop just as they are used to: by entering their familiar online banking login details and confirmation codes ensuring a maximum level of security. You will receive a real-time transaction confirmation immediately after the transfer has been listed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sofort.com/eng-INT/"><img style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;" src="https://www.sofort.com/var/sofort/storage/images/media/images/logos/sofort-ag-the-payment-network/651-9-ger-DE/SOFORT-AG-The-Payment-Network_header.png" alt="Sofort Banking" />SOFORT Banking</a> is a direct payment system and works like an automated advanced payment (by bank transfer) within seconds.</p>
<p>When shopping online, your customer selects SOFORT Banking as a payment method. Then, your customer selects his/her country and enters the bank sort code into a securely encrypted payment wizard. Afterwards, the customer enters his/her online banking login details and confirms the credit transfer by entering a confirmation code.</p>
<p>Your benefit: You will receive a real-time transaction confirmation that a transfer has been listed.</p>

Usually if the problem is within the core files, we follow security by obscurity, which means we do not exactly explain where to find the exploit. But the latest possible sql injection is in fact a matter of the template. So this time we will explain exactly what happened.</p>
